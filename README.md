# Coin Flip Streaks
## A python program that takes a sample of coin flips and displays the chance to get six consecutive flips in a row.
This is the second project at the end of Chapter 4 of Automate the Boring Stuff. I had fun writing this program. It is interesting to see how quickly the program executes a million coin flips and calculates the probability of getting six in a row.
